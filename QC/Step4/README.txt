Step4 :  Calculating kinship and PCA using high-quality SNPs. 
---

High-quality SNPs were selected by using HighQuality.sh, which filtered:
· a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.1%
· call rate > 99%
· HWE P-value > 1x10^-6. 
· two rounds of pruning (Plink parameters: -indep-pairwise 200 1000.1 and -indep-pairwise 200 100 0.05).

Duplicated individuals were identified using king software in NoDuplicated.sh, with results saved in the king.con file. 
An example of the first few lines of this file is provided (king_example.con).

Kinship coefficients were calculated with Relative.sh, with a kinship threshold set at 0.0884 (second-degree relatives). 
An example of the first few lines of kinship result was provided (ukb_wes_chr_all_king_sample_qc.kin0).
To maximize sample retention, for each pair with a kinship coefficient > 0.0884, we iteratively removed individuals related to multiple others until none remained, then randomly removed one individual from each related pair by using keep_unrelated_2nd.R. 

Finally, we removed duplicated and second-degree related samples from the entire dataset and the high-quality variants. 
PCA was then calculated using high-quality variants (PCA.sh), and the first 10 PCA (an example: ukb_wes_chr_all_king_sample_qc_final_unrelated.eigenval) were used as covariates in association tests for common and rare variants.
